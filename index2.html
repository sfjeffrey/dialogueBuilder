    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The working title of this game is <b>"Cupcake Tycoon: Corruption is Magic"</b>.
        You take the role of Pinkie Pie just as she is gaining more responsibilities as the Sugarcuge Corner bakery
        and embark on a journey that takes it from a rural "Mom and Pop" to a Global Confectionary Giant.
        Along the way experience the ups and downs of business as well as the morally gray under belly
        of the cut throat world of bakeing.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>So how is this game <i>adult</i>?</h1>
    <p>Without being coy, the game is explicitely pornographic because as a driving game mechanic
        Pinky must systematically kidnap her friends, lock them in her basement, give them a potion
        that makes them hermaphrodites, and harvest their semen for its magical confectionary
        qualities. To put it simply. <br>
        If that hasn't scared you off keep reading how you (that's right specifically you) can contribute!
    </p>
    <h2>I wanna contribute!</h2>
    <p>You're in luck! Here's what I am asking the greater Brony community, and innevitably
        the small percentage who haven't turned away in disgust, to do:<br>
        In my game there's a random dialogue system. Several of the characters you interact with
        can share in a little branching chit chat with Pinky. What's even cooler is that this
        system even responds to what's going on in the game to select appropriate dialogue.
        So what do you do? Well I'd like there to be lots of dialogue. I mean a lot a lot.
        I'd be happy if there was so much dialogue you'd never see the same conversation twice, or
        could never see it all in one playthrough. I figure that'd be a small task for a community
        as creative and productive as Bronies.
    </p>
    <h2>So how do I do it?</h2>
    <p>Well I've made this tool called the Dialogue Builder which is available
        <a href=dialogueMaker.html>here</a> and in the quicklinks. Inside you'll find everything you'll
        need to easily write branching tree dialogue, set the story requirments for your dialogue, and, 
        I hope, have fun doing so. Which brings me to...
    </p>
    <h2>Why should I do this?</h2>
    <p>It's my hope that the tool is fun to use. You can even take the code the tool produces and load it into
        the <a href=dialogueDemo.html>Dialogue Demo</a> and see it in action! It'd also be
        rad of you to make something for the game and send it to me inbetween making
        ponies recite your favorite memes.<br>
        Additionally, contirbutors who wish will get put into the credits. And, if peddling
        OCs are your thing it'll only be the top contributors I even consider adding to the game.
    </p>
    <h3>Sounds like you're trying to make us do all the work!</h3>
    <p>Not at all. I am making no threats of non-delivery contingent on participation. I decided
    I wanted mountains textual content and crowd sourcing it seemed like a good idea.
    The community gets a chance to participate in a project that is ultimetaly for the community.
