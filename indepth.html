        <h3 align="center">The Story</h3>
        <p>The game begins as Mr. and Mrs. Cake inform Pinky Pie that they're planning to retire.
            Their hope had been to hire an apprentice and teach them the ins and outs of
            the business. Unfortunately that never happened, and pressed for time on the plans,
            they've chosen to promote you to the new manager.<br>
            It's now up to Pinky to keep the Sugarcube Corner Bakery from closing down.
        </p>
        <h3>The Tweest</h3>
        <p>There is, of course, a bit of a surprise. There is a secret, morally questionable,
            aspect to the business that Pinky must learn in order to not only keep
            Sugarcube Corner alive, but let it grow.<br>
            The secret ingredient in all truly epic confections is a magical substance
            extracted from specially enchanted ponies.<br>
            The enchantment?<br>
            Mares that have been altered with the use of a powerful portion to 
            have the genitalia of stallions.<br>
            The substance?<br>
            Their cum, which must be expertly extracted.<br>
            The ponies?<br>
            Why, only you personal best friends will do. Friendship <i>is</i> magic after all.
        </p>
        <h3>The Game</h3>
        <p>Pinky Pie is now effectively in charge of Sugarcube corner. Her mentor's retirement is
            at stake, also it's a chance to prove she's mature enough and smart enough to handle the responsibility.
            <br>
            Buying ingredients, perfecting recipes, knowing what products are popular, and managing debt
             are all things that rest squarely on Pinky's back.<br>
             To make things worse, she must make the decision as to which of her friends whose life she has to
             change forever, how she's going to take care of them once they're in her clutches, and
             how their absence from public life will affect her business.
        </p>
        <h3>Competition isn't all smiles smiles smiles.</h3>
        <p>Along the way Pinky will learn that it isn't enough for her to succeed, others must fail.
            Undermine the competition. It's only when other bakeries close that you gain their
            business.
