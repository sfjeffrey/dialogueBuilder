<div id="parameterString" class="explenationText"><b>Capture Status:</b><br>
    The buttons in these boxes determine if your dialogue will appear based on 
    who has or hasn't been kidnapped yet. For instance: If you set Rarity to 'Free' 
    your dialogue will only appear if Rarity hasn't been kidnapped. Useful for 
    Dialogue which refernces her in some way. Like if Fluttershy were to say:<br>
    <i>Oh I just spoke with Rarity. She says she's very purple.</i><br>
    You'd only want that conversation to appear while Rarity is available to be talked 
    to. If however you want to reference how Rarity is missing. Like:<br>
    <i>Gee I wonder what happened to Rarity?</i><br>
    You'd want her to be set to Bound.<br>Set it to 'Null' when it doesn't matter,
    for instance if the dialogue doesn't reference them.<br>
    Remember that this also applies to the Pony talking, and the pony speaking MUST 
    be set to either 'Free' or 'Bound'</div>
    
    <div id=characterString class="explenationText"><b>Character:</b><br>
    This is the character who will speak this dialogue. It is their stats referenced 
    in the boxes below. Remember to set their capture status to either Bound or Free.</div>

    <div id=healthString class="explenationText"><b>Health:</b><br>
    This is the range of health that your dialogue will appear within. 
    Meaning that if the character's health is above the maximum or below the minimum 
    the conversation will not be available for selection.<br>
    Make your conversation contextual to your selection. If they're health is low 
    make their conversation about how sick they feel or perhaps pleading to go to a 
    doctor. 50 is considered to be 'normal' while <26 is considered sick, and 
    >74 is considered to be very healthy.<br>
    Remember that Free ponies' health is always 50. If your conversation excludes 
    50 while they're free your conversation will never appear.</div>
    
<div id=psychiString class="explenationText">"<b>Psychi:</b><br>
    This is the range of psychi that your dialogue will appear within. 
    Meaning that if the character's psychi is above the maximum or below the minimum 
    the conversation will not be available for selection.<br>
    Make your conversation contextual to your selection. If they're psychi is low 
    make their conversation crazy or nonsensical. The exact nature of their psychosis 
    is up to you. 50 is considered to be 'normal' while <26 is considered crazy, and 
    >74 is considered to be...I don't know "really sane".<br>
    Remember that Free ponies' psychi is always 50. If your conversation excludes 
    50 while they're free your conversation will never appear.</div>
    
<div id=stockholmString class="explenationText">"<b>Stockholm:</b><br>
    This is the range of Stockholm syndrome that your dialogue will appear within. 
    Meaning that if the character's Stockholm is above the maximum or below the minimum 
    the conversation will not be available for selection.<br>
    Make your conversation contextual to your selection. If they're Stockholm is low 
    make their conversation about how they want to escape. The Stockhom stat is 
    different from health and psychi. First it builds really slowly. Second, 50 is not 
    considered to be 'normal' 0 is. The Stockholm stat is more like a percent of how 
    much they want to stay with you. On the low end your captive should only want 
    to leave. On the high she should be accepting that she isn't. In the middle 
    it could be that your relationship is strained but cordial. Extreme values on 
    the stockholm stat will be scrutinized very closely for consideration.<br>
    Remember that Free ponies' Stockholm is always 0. If your conversation excludes 
    0 while they're free your conversation will never appear.</div>

<div id=briefString class="explenationText">'<b>What to do:</b><br>
    Here's what's going on. This page is a tool for building 'Conversations'. 
    A conversation, as far as the game is concerned, is a game entity that 
    contains a branching path of dialogue. Each junction in the path is something 
    the character says, and from there each of your responses is a possible path 
    to take to the next set of dialogue.<br><br>
    The way this works is that in the game you have the option to speak with the
     characters you meet. When you select that option the game randomly selects 
    a conversation with truthful <b>parameters</b> and displays it. 
    Here you can write dialogue, and the possible responses. Then you set the parameters,
    and finally hit 'Finalize' and the resulting code can be put into the game.
    <br><br><b>Parameters</b> are what the game checks to see if your conversation is valid. 
    The top set of radio buttons determines whether or not a particular character has been 
    kidnapped by you, as PinkiePie. The column of figures on the right side are for 
    the character who will be speaking. Their name, the maximum and minimum 
    health/psychi/stockholm syndrome that character must have for your conversation to appear. 
    The <span style="background-color:grey;color:white;">&nbspE&nbsp</span> buttons
    go more in depth into each parameter.<br><br>
    
    I've tried to make this as user friendly as possible and littered it with
    tons of help documentations, but if I still managed to make this too complicated
    to use please let me know what doesn't make sense so I can fix it.
    </div>

<div id=tipsString class="explenationText">'<b>Some tips:</b><br><br>
    When you have reached the end of a particular line of conversation press 
    "Close Branch" without entering any responses and it will loop back to the next 
    peice of dialogue with no responses.<br><br>
    
    Narrow stat margins open up the possibility for highly contextual dialogue. 
    Wide state margins make your dialogue more likely to appear. If your conversation is
    very general go ahead and give it wide margins, but context sensitive narrow margin dialogue
    is bound to be more interesting.<br><br>
    
    Character states set to "bound" means this dialogue will only appear when 
    that character has been kidnapped. Free is only if they are free, and "null" 
    is for if it does not matter. Something such as "<i>Applejack has been missing</i>" 
    should only appear if Applejack has been captured. Something like 
    "<i>I went swimming with Applejack yesturday</i>" should only be said when applejack is free.<br><br>
    
    If your dialogue is too long to fit into the box, write as much as you can 
    then add 'cont...' as it's only response and continue in the next module<br><br>
    
    The text in the response buttons is limited and meant more as the "idea" of
    what Pinky is saying rather than what she's actually saying. But if you want her 
    say something specific type it into the dialogue with '&ltpinky>' at the beginning
    of her words, and '&lt/pinky>' at the end. Words in the 'pinky tags' will appear
    as her dialogue and not the NPC's<br><br>
    
    The tool will remind you what dialogue was just spoken so you know what responses to type,
    but there are bound to be vague lines, like if all they're saying is "<i>No.</i>",
    so it might be a good idea to write down the context for your vague dialogue modules.<br><br>
    
    When a pony that can be kidnapped has not yet been kidnapped their health and
    psychi are always at 50 and their stockholm is always 0. If you choose to make a dialogue
    that is spoken when the character is free, but excludes those default stats, then you
    guarentee that your conversation will never take place. You might as well leave 
    the parameters at default in this case.<br><br>
    </div>

<div id=reqString class="explenationText"><B>All conversations must have the following:</b><br><br>
    The speaking character must have their status set to either Free or Bound.<br><br>
    No profanity. This sure isn't a family game, but bad words just don't jive with the 
    intended feel of the game. Explicit descriptions of sex acts or genitalia are OK.<br><br> 
    
    While dialogue that references the results of other dialogues would be really cool 
    it is also too complicated for this particular game. Conversations are chosen at 
    random within the defined parameters. Any dialogue that references other dialogue 
    will surely be seen out of order.<br><br>
    
    The game will not be referencing any major plot points in the show. Assume this 
    game takes place in the middle of season 2, but really the game is not meant to 
    coincide with the show's timeline.<br><br>
    
    Clearly indicate for whome the dialogue belongs.
    If you found this builder in a thread somewhere and it has died you can e-mail 
    your submission to '<b>zst.xkn@gmail.com</b>' put 'mlp_cim' in the subject line 
    to ensure your submission gets seen.<br><br>
    Ultimetaly submissions are only chosen if I like them. If they're clever, funny, 
    or interesting then they'll probably get selected. I really can't imagine there being 
    a limit to the number of dialogue options so unless I really hate your 
    submission it'll probably get picked<br><br>
    
    If you're <i>really</i> interested in being involved in the game feel free 
    to ask me if there's anything you can do. Collecting sound effects, limited 
    voice work, and <i>maybe</i> OC cameos are all low skill things I need that 
    anyone could do. Aside from that some static artwork and flash animations are
